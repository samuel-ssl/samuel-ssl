## About Me

I'm a game programmer with a background in Design, which gives me a strong understanding of player experience, mechanic clarity, and system cohesion.

I specialize in gameplay systems architecture, modular design, and interaction-driven mechanics.  
During my graduation project, I acted as the Lead Programmer, designing and implementing the core systems of a 2D narrative-driven game.

My goal is to grow as a Game Engineer by building clean, scalable systems that support both creative and technical vision.
